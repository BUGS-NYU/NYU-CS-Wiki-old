## About

Projects Showcase Event was a collaboration between BUGS@NYU, Tech@NYU, WinC and Girls Who Code in Spring 2021. Curious to see what other students are working on during Covid, we plan the event virtually and invite students across campus to show us what they have been tinkering with during the year. Below are the projects presented during the event

## [Py2Ruby](https://www.py2ruby.com/) by [Kenny Yip](https://www.kennyyip.com/)

Py2Ruby is an online web application with a built-in code editor that takes in Python code and converts the syntax to ruby code via a code parser/translator that I wrote myself. This is especially useful if someone needs to learn ruby or if they find a piece of code in python and would like to convert it to ruby to add to their script. Py2Ruby is fully functional and has been tested to fully and accurately convert 1000+ lines of code. In the future, I would consider adding Ruby to Python translate feature as it is currently a one way translation, or a Java to C++/C++ to Java translator.

## [JustShoot](https://rachelombok.com/justshoot) by [Rachel Ombok](https://rachelombok.com/)

JustShoot is a community platform for photo enthusiasts to find cool locations for photo shoots. You can browse the map and search for snap spots posted by the JustShoot community. Get inspired by photographers in the area, find great spots to take photos, and share your own. To share photos with the community, double click the map or press the plus in the top right corner, upload your photo, set the correct location, and add a little writeup and details. The result is a collaborative open community and platform for photography enthusiasts, both amateur and professional.

## [Hoji](https://github.com/mattfan00/hoji) by [Matthew Fan](https://www.matthewfan.io/)

hoji is a mindful blogging platform that allows users to share long posts and spontaneous thoughts. With hoji, common concepts found in social media platforms are stripped away: no likes and follows, sharing to other platforms, or complex recommendation algorithms. The focus is less on the platform itself, but rather the people and ideas that are posted to it.
